## Project Description

The Gender Classification Project aims to accurately classify the gender of speakers using audio data. The project includes a trained neural network model that processes audio files and predicts the gender of the speaker. The dataset consists of various audio files categorized by gender.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gender-classification-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd gender-classification-project
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your audio files:**
   - Place your audio files in the `path/` directory.
   - Ensure the files are in `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.opus` formats.

2. **Run the Audio Data Extraction script:**
   ```sh
   python audiodataextraction.py
   ```

3. **View the results:**
   - The extracted features results will be displayed in the console, copy paste the features in the model 'Gender_Recognition_using_Voice_Signals.ipynb'.
